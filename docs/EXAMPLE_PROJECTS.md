## Tips for Creating Your Own Project Descriptions

### Be Specific

Include details about:

- Dimensions (e.g., "12x16 feet")
- Materials (e.g., "pressure-treated lumber", "composite decking")
- Special features (e.g., "built-in benches", "overhead lighting")
- Utilities needed (e.g., "basic electrical", "plumbing hookup")

### Example Template

```text
Build a [size] [type of structure] with [material 1], [material 2],
[special feature 1], [special feature 2], and [utility requirements].
```

### Good Example

✅ "Build an 8x10 garden shed with cedar siding, metal roof, two windows, double doors, and electrical outlet."

### Less Effective Example

❌ "Build a shed with some stuff."

## Using Dynamic Planning

For the most interesting results, try the same project with both modes:

1. **Standard Template**: Use a predefined project type (Kitchen Remodel, Bathroom Remodel, etc.)
2. **Dynamic Planning**: Enable the "Generate custom AI plan" checkbox to see AI-generated task breakdowns

Dynamic planning will create tasks specifically tailored to your description, while templates provide consistent, predefined workflows.

## Notes

- All projects will go through the standard construction phases: Planning, Permitting, Foundation, Framing, Rough-in, Inspection, Finishing, and Final Inspection
- Task complexity and count will vary based on project description detail
- The AI will automatically determine required permits, materials, and subcontractors
- Projects run autonomously from start to finish with no manual intervention required
