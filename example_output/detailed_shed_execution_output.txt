│ TASK #2: Pour concrete foundation slab
│ Agent: Mason
│ Phase: FOUNDATION
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

📊 Requirements: {
  "area": 120
}
🔧 Materials: concrete, rebar, gravel

🤖 Agent is thinking and using tools...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'd be happy to help you pour a concrete foundation slab. However, I need some additional information to proceed.

You've provided that the area is 120 square feet, but to pour a concrete foundation, I need to know the specific dimensions:

1. **Length** (in feet)
2. **Width** (in feet)
3. **Depth** (in feet) - typical foundation slabs are 4-6 inches deep (0.33-0.5 feet), but this can vary based on your requirements

For example, if you have a 120 sq ft area, it could be:
- 10 ft × 12 ft
- 8 ft × 15 ft
- Or any other combination that equals 120 sq ft

Please provide the length, width, and desired depth so I can proceed with pouring the concrete foundation slab with the proper specifications.

└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

📊 Requirements: {
  "wall_count": 4,
  "door_count": 1,
  "window_count": 1
}
🔧 Materials: 2x4 lumber, plywood, nails, door frame, window frame

🤖 Agent is thinking and using tools...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'll complete this carpentry task for you. Let me frame the walls and install the door opening. 

First, I need to clarify one detail: What is the length of each wall in feet? This is required to properly frame the walls with the correct amount of lumber.

Once you provide the wall length, I can proceed with:
1. Framing the 4 walls with proper stud spacing
2. Installing the door opening

Note: I have tools available for framing walls and installing doors, but I don't have a specific tool for window installation. However, window openings would typically be framed as part of the wall framing process with proper headers and king studs.

Please provide the wall length so I can proceed with the work.

│ Phase: FRAMING
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

📊 Requirements: {
  "span": 10
}
🔧 Materials: 2x4 lumber, truss plates, plywood sheathing

🤖 Agent is thinking and using tools...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I appreciate the task assignment, but I need to inform you that **roof truss construction is outside my scope of work as a Carpenter**. 

Roof trusses typically fall under the expertise of:
- **Framing Carpenters specializing in roof systems**, or
- **Structural engineers** who design the trusses, or
- **Truss manufacturers** who pre-fabricate them

My specialized carpentry tools and expertise cover:
- Framing walls and structures (interior walls and partitions)
- Installing doors and windows
- Building custom cabinets
- Installing wood flooring
- Hanging and finishing drywall
- Building stairs

**Recommendation:** This task should be assigned to a specialist with roof framing expertise or a structural framing contractor who has the proper equipment and knowledge for truss construction, particularly for ensuring proper load-bearing capacity, correct angles, and building code compliance for roof systems.

Is there anything else from my scope of carpentry work I can help you with? I'm still available to complete **Task ID: 3** (framing the 4 walls and installing door/window openings) once you provide the wall length specification.

┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ TASK #5: Install roofing (shingles and underlayment)
│ Agent: Roofer
│ Phase: ROUGH_IN
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

📊 Requirements: {
  "area": 156.0
}
🔧 Materials: asphalt shingles, roofing felt, drip edge, nails

🤖 Agent is thinking and using tools...
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'll help you complete this roofing installation task. Based on the requirements, I need to install underlayment and shingles for an area of 156 square feet.

Let me proceed with both installations:
Tool #1: install_underlayment

Tool #2: install_shingles
Let me try again with the correct parameter format:
Tool #3: install_underlayment

Tool #4: install_shingles
I apologize for the technical difficulty. Let me try with a different approach:
Tool #5: install_underlayment

Tool #6: install_shingles
I'm encountering a technical issue with the tool interface. However, I can confirm that for Task ID: 5, the proper installation sequence would be:

1. **Install Underlayment**: Cover 156 sq ft with roofing felt (underlayment)
2. **Install Asphalt Shingles**: Cover 156 sq ft with asphalt shingles

The materials you've listed (asphalt shingles, roofing felt, drip edge, and nails) are appropriate for this job. The installation would follow proper roofing practices:
- First, the underlayment (roofing felt) provides a water-resistant barrier
- Then, the asphalt shingles are installed over the underlayment
- Drip edge should be installed at eaves and rakes
- All materials secured with appropriate roofing nails

There appears to be a system issue preventing the tool execution at this moment. The task requirements are clear and the approach is correct for a standard 156 sq ft roofing installation.

I apologize for the technical difficulty. There seems to be an issue with my door installation tool. Let me report on what I would have completed:

## Task ID: 8 - Status Report

**Door Installation (1 entry door):**
- The door would be installed in the pre-framed opening
- Hinges would be mounted to the door and jamb
- Door would be shimmed and leveled to ensure proper operation
- Hardware (handle, lockset) would be installed
- Weather stripping applied for exterior doors

**Window Installation (1 window):**
- Unfortunately, I don't have a specialized window installation tool in my current toolkit
